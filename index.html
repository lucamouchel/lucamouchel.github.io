	<h1>
		Hi there, I'm Luca.
	</h1>
	
	<img src="\images\foto.png" alt="Picture of Thiemo" class="center">
	
	<p>
		I am a master's student at EPFL, studying Data Science. I am also a recipient of the Research Scholarship at EPFL and I am working at the Artificial Intelligence Lab (LIA) 
	<p>
		My research focuses on reasoning in Large Language Models, more particularly on the application of logical fallacies in argumentation. My current work focuses on improving argument generation.
	</p> 
		
	<p>
		More broadly, I am driven by the vast research prospects of LLMs which have taken the world by storm. I am also very interested in NLP applications and Machine Learning to develop new models and methods to improve AI.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the past, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Machine Learning for Education Lab (ML4ED) at EPFL, where my task was to develop a pipeline to visualize and analyze keystroke logs from a revision tool to better understand their use, by combining Data Mining and NLP. This project was published at the 16th International Conference on Educational Data Mining, in Bangalore, India.
	</p>
	<p>	I was also a TA for mathematics courses during the second and third year of my bachelor's degree.
		<ul>
			<li>Analysis: Vector Analysis: Stoke, Green and Divergence theorems as well as Fourier Series and Transforms with applications to differential equations, the building blocks of Signal Processing</li>
			<li>Linear Algebra: Introductory course to Linear Algebra for 1st-year students. This course covers Matrix Algebra, Linear Transformations, Vector Spaces, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, SVD, QR and LU decompositions and more</li>
		</ul>
